        About Wikipedia
    </h1>
    <p>
        <a href="~" runat="server">Wikipedia</a> is a multilingual, web-based, free-content
        encyclopedia project based on an openly editable model. The name "Wikipedia" is
        a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites,
        from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles
        provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous Internet volunteers who
        write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia
        articles (except in certain cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption
        or vandalism). Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or with their
        real identity, if they choose. The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates
        are the Five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines
        to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar
        with them before contributing.

        Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest
        reference websites, attracting nearly 78 million visitors monthly as of January
        2010. There are more than 91,000 active contributors working on more than 17,000,000
        articles in more than 270 languages. As of today, there are 3,507,008 articles in
        English. Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively
        make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment
        the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia.
